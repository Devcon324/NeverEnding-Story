# The-NeverEnding-Story

## Background Information, How It's Made

### What is this?

We follow Dave, our Programmed Paladin on his adventure!

This is an self-continuing story that is updated 3x a day on GitHub.

Built with Generative Artificial Intelligence using Meta's llama3 70b Large Language Model. This project accomplishes these steps:

1. Start a story with an initial story chunk (some paragraphs)
2. Use the previous story chunk as context to write the next story chunk
3. Write the stories to this README.md file with dated entries
4. automate the git commands to commit and push to this repository
5. cronjob the script to run 3x a day at 00:00, 08:00, and 16:00

### Features I found cool when building

#### using groq API

Using Groq for LLM's is intuitive and easy. the syntax and responses received from the model are easily understood and can allow for great debugging.

The fact this model is free (hopefully for a long time) allows for the great learning and exploration of using LLM's to make projects like this that explore how mnodels behave when in a continuous conversation.

## The Story of Dave the Programmed Paladin

As the worn leather straps creaked and the wooden wheels groaned, the rickety wagon lurched forward, carrying its cargo of weathered peasants toward the distant promise of Bluestone. Among them, Dave the Paladin sat pensively, his calloused hands grasping the worn hilt of his sword, his piercing blue eyes gazing out at the rolling hills and verdant forests of Faerûn. The monastery, once a bastion of righteousness and purpose, had grown stifling in its routine; the thrill of battle, the rush of questing, and the whispers of ancient lore had beckoned him forth. With a quiet sense of determination, Dave had packed his meager belongings and bid farewell to his brothers, setting out into the unknown.

As the wagon rumbled onward, the peasant driver, a grizzled old man named Gorvoth, pointed a gnarled finger toward the horizon. "See that, friends? That's the Bluestone River, markin' the boundary o' the town. You'll find work aplenty in Bluestone, but don't be thinkin' it's all coin and comfort. Strange happenings 'ave been reported in them parts – whispers o' dark creatures lurkin' in the woods, and strange noises comin' from the old ruins." The other passengers exchanged nervous glances, but Dave's eyes sparkled with excitement. This was what he had been searching for – adventure, danger, and the chance to prove his mettle.

As the wagon approached the town's bustling market square, the cacophony of sounds and smells assaulted Dave's senses. Merchants hawked their wares, while travelers and locals alike haggled over prices. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the nearby ovens, mingling with the acrid tang of hot metal from the blacksmith's forge. Dave's stomach growled in response, reminding him that he had not eaten since dawn. With a nod to Gorvoth, he disembarked, his worn boots thudding against the cobblestones as he made his way toward the bustling tavern, its sign creaking in the gentle breeze: "The Rusty Goblet".

As he pushed open the door, the warm glow of lanterns and the murmur of patrons enveloped him, immediately making him feel more at home. A stout dwarf, his beard a fiery red, greeted Dave with a hearty clap on the back. "Welcome, friend! I'm Grimbold Ironfist, the proprietor o' this humble establishment. What brings ye to Bluestone? Are ye lookin' for work, or just lookin' to rest yer bones?" Dave's eyes roved the tavern, taking in the eclectic assortment of patrons – a hooded figure sipping a mug of ale in the corner, a pair of half-elves engaged in a heated darts competition, and a gruff-looking human, eyeing him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. It was time to introduce himself, and see where the road of adventure would lead him.

As Dave's gaze met Grimbold's, a warm smile creased the dwarf's face, his eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief. "Ah, a paladin, if I'm not mistaken? We don't get many of your kind 'round these parts. What's your story, friend? What brings a noble soul like yours to our humble town?" The patrons of the tavern, sensing the arrival of a potential hero, began to take notice, their conversations dying down as they turned to regard Dave with interest. The hooded figure in the corner, however, remained steadfast in their anonymity, their gaze fixed intently on the paladin.

Dave, accustomed to the scrutiny, stood tall, his broad shoulders squaring as he replied, "I am Dave, a paladin of the Order of the Dawn. I've come seeking adventure, and perhaps a chance to prove myself against the darkness that's said to be gathering in these parts." He paused, his eyes scanning the room once more, his hand instinctively reaching for the hilt of his sword. "I've heard rumors of strange happenings in the woods, and whispers of an ancient evil stirring in the ruins. I aim to uncover the truth behind these whispers, and put an end to whatever evil is plaguing this land."

Grimbold's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm as he slapped Dave on the back once more. "Ah, you're lookin' for the Wyrmwood, aren't ye? The old ruins, deep in the heart o' the forest. They say it's cursed, that anyone who ventures in never returns. But I reckon you're not one to believe in rumors, eh, paladin?" The dwarf winked, a sly grin spreading across his face. "I might know a thing or two about the Wyrmwood. I've got a friend, a local guide, who's been in there and back again. He might be willin' to share his knowledge... for a price, o' course."

As Grimbold spoke, the gruff-looking human, who had been eyeing Dave with suspicion, pushed his chair back, the wooden legs scraping against the floor. "Hold up, paladin. I've got a word to say." His voice was low and gravelly, his tone laced with a hint of menace. "You're not the first one to come in here lookin' for adventure, and you won't be the last. But you're not goin' anywhere near the Wyrmwood without talkin' to me first." He paused, his gaze narrowing as he extended a calloused hand. "Name's Thrain Blackbeard. I'm the one who knows what's really goin' on in these woods."

The warmth of the tavern's fire pit seemed to pulse in rhythm with the sudden tension that filled the air, as if the flames themselves were drawn to the threads of intrigue that now connected the gathered patrons. Grimbold's eyes darted between Dave and Thrain, a calculating glint in their depths, as he weighed the odds of this unexpected confrontation. The hooded figure, still shrouded in mystery, remained statue-still, yet seemed to absorb every nuance of the unfolding drama.

Dave, unfazed by Thrain's gruff demeanor, accepted the proffered hand, his grip firm but not aggressive. "Thrain Blackbeard, I've heard the name. You're a local... entrepreneur, I understand?" He released Thrain's hand, his gaze probing the human's rugged features, searching for the hidden motivations behind his words. "I'm willing to listen, Thrain. What do you know of the Wyrmwood, and what makes you think I should heed your counsel?"

Thrain's grip had been like a vice, but his smile was a thin-lipped thing, devoid of genuine warmth. "You think you're the first paladin to come traipsing in here, thinking to slay dragons and right wrongs?" He snorted, a dry, humorless sound. "I've seen it before, boy. You're not going to change a thing. But I can help you... for a price." His eyes flicked to Grimbold, and back to Dave, a hint of warning in their depths. "You see, I've got... connections, with those who know the Wyrmwood's secrets. And I'm willing to share, if you're willing to listen."

As Thrain spoke, the tavern's patrons began to murmur among themselves, their whispers weaving a tapestry of speculation and intrigue. The fire crackled, sending shadows dancing across the walls, as if the very spirits of the land were drawing closer, eager to witness the unfolding drama. Grimbold, sensing an opportunity, leaned in, his voice a conspiratorial whisper. "You see, paladin, Thrain here might just be the key to unlocking the secrets of the Wyrmwood. But be warned, his help comes at a steep price... one that might just cost you more than gold or silver."

The air grew thick with anticipation as the patrons' whispers swelled into a palpable hum, each face aglow with the golden light of the fire pit. Dave's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with the implications of Thrain's words. Connections with those who knew the Wyrmwood's secrets? It was a tantalizing prospect, one that might just tip the scales in his favor. Yet, Grimbold's enigmatic warning had planted a seed of doubt, and Dave's instincts screamed for caution.

As he pondered the risks and benefits, the hooded figure finally stirred, its movements a slow, deliberate unfolding, as if it had been a statue come to life. With an economy of motion, the figure pushed back its hood, revealing a tapestry of scars that crisscrossed its cheekbones and forehead. The eyes, a piercing shade of indigo, gleamed in the firelight as the figure spoke in a voice that was barely audible, yet carried an otherworldly authority.

"Thrain Blackbeard's price is not for the faint of heart," it said, the words dripping with an almost forgotten dialect. "You will pay in secrets, in fragments of your soul. Are you prepared to make such a cost?" The figure's gaze locked onto Dave, its eyes burning with an unnerving intensity. Thrain, meanwhile, merely chuckled, the sound like dry leaves rustling in the underbrush.

Grimbold's whispers wove a counterpoint to the hooded figure's ominous warning, his words a tantalizing mixture of promise and menace. "Oh, paladin, Thrain's connections run deep indeed. He knows the leaders of the Wildwalker clans, the whispering women of the Underbrook, and the master-scholars of the Azure Spire. He can unlock doors that have been sealed for centuries, grant you access to forbidden knowledge... but at what cost?" The atmosphere in the tavern seemed to stretch to the breaking point, as the gathered patrons held their collective breath, awaiting Dave's response.

In the silence, the fire crackled and spat, casting eerie silhouettes across the walls as the shadows danced in anticipation of the paladin's answer. It was as if the very fate of the Wyrmwood hung in the balance, and Dave's next move would set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of history forever.

As the weight of the hooded figure's words settled upon him, Dave felt the burden of his decision acutely. The eyes of the patrons seemed to bore into his very soul, each one a reminder that the path he chose would have far-reaching consequences, not just for himself, but for the fragile balance of power in the Wyrmwood. The fire pit's warmth seemed to seep into his bones, but he felt a cold, creeping dread as he met the figure's unflinching gaze.

Thrain's chuckle had been a jarring note in the tense atmosphere, a macabre melody that seemed to echo through the tavern like a death knell. And yet, it was Grimbold's words that held the greatest sway over Dave's heart. The promise of forbidden knowledge and ancient secrets was a siren's call, one that had lured him to this point and would continue to draw him in, no matter the danger.

Dave's eyes roved the room, drinking in the expectant faces and the flickering shadows that danced upon the walls. In the pause, a low murmuring had begun to swell, as the patrons began to speculate on the paladin's decision. Some shook their heads in a mixture of disapproval and awe, while others seemed to writhe with a morbid fascination, as if they were eager to witness the spectacle of Dave's downfall.

As he took a deep breath, the air in the tavern seemed to hold its collective breath. And then, in a voice that rang clear and steady, Dave spoke the words that would change the course of his fate: "I'm willing to pay the price." The patrons' collective gasp seemed to have a life of its own, a living, breathing thing that pulsed with a power all its own. Thrain's laughter, when it came, was like a crack of thunder on a summer's day, a sound that split the air apart and left in its wake a silence so profound that it seemed to redefine the very meaning of stillness.

The hooded figure's eyes seemed to flash with an otherworldly energy, as if they had drunk in Dave's words and were now transforming them into something dark and primal. It leaned forward, its movements sinuous and predatory, and Dave could feel the power that emanated from it – a power that was both mesmerizing and terrifying. And in the pause that followed, as the patrons held their collective breath, the figure spoke in a voice that seemed to hold a thousand different meanings, each one more complex and frightening than the last: "Then let us begin."
