# The-NeverEnding-Story

## Background Information, How It's Made

### What is this?

We follow Dave, our Programmed Paladin on his adventure!

This is an self-continuing story that is updated 3x a day on GitHub.

Built with Generative Artificial Intelligence using Meta's llama3 70b Large Language Model. This project accomplishes these steps:

1. Start a story with an initial story chunk (some paragraphs)
2. Use the previous story chunk as context to write the next story chunk
3. Write the stories to this README.md file with dated entries
4. automate the git commands to commit and push to this repository
5. cronjob the script to run 3x a day at 00:00, 08:00, and 16:00

### Features I found cool when building

#### using groq API

Using Groq for LLM's is intuitive and easy. the syntax and responses received from the model are easily understood and can allow for great debugging.

The fact this model is free (hopefully for a long time) allows for the great learning and exploration of using LLM's to make projects like this that explore how mnodels behave when in a continuous conversation.

## The Story of Dave the Programmed Paladin

The sun was setting over the rolling hills of Faerûn as a worn wagon rattled along the dusty road. Inside, a mix of tired peasants huddled together, their faces etched with the weariness of travel. Amidst them sat Dave, a young paladin with a sense of restlessness that seemed to grow by the day. Clad in simple, unadorned armor, his blond hair tied back in a ponytail, he gazed out at the horizon, his eyes fixed on the faint outline of the StarMountains in the distance. His fellow travelers, all folk who had never ventured far from their humble beginnings, watched him with curiosity and suspicion. This was, after all, a paladin leaving the safety of a monastery to traverse the unpredictable roads of Faerûn.

"Where are ye headed, lad?" asked a gruff old fellow to Dave's left. His name was Grimbold Ironfist, a sturdy blacksmith from a small village to the north. Grimbold had lost an arm in battle and sported a gleaming mechanical replacement that creaked as he shifted on the wooden bench.

"I'm headed to Bluestone," Dave replied, his voice firm but laced with a hint of trepidation. "I've heard the town is seeking brave adventurers to... aid in the protection of its citizens."

A hooded figure near the back of the wagon leaned forward, eyes glinting with curiosity. "Protection from what, exactly?" she asked, her voice husky and mysterious.

Dave's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his sword, an unadorned steel blade he had been given by the monks at the monastery. "I've heard rumors of strange happenings in the nearby forests – whispers of goblins and wild beasts. Bluestone needs someone to investigate."

The peasants exchanged uneasy glances, no doubt thinking about the perils that lay ahead. As for Dave, he felt a thrill of excitement course through his veins, the prospect of adventure igniting a fire within him.

"You're either brave or crazy," Grimbold chuckled, eyeing Dave's unwavering determination. "I reckon it's a bit of both."

The wagon rumbled onward, the travelers subsiding into silence as night began to fall. The stars twinkled above, casting a magical glow over the landscape, as the passengers drifted off to sleep, their dreams filled with the promise of the unknown adventures that lay ahead.
