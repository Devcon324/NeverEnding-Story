# The NeverEnding Story

## What is this?

We follow **Dave**, our Programmed Paladin on his adventure!

This is an **self-continuing** story that is **automatically updated 3x a day to this GitHub repository.**
**Enjoy you morning coffee and read where dave is at!** The story is updated at **12:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time**

### [Click Here to Read Dave's Story Below](#the-story-of-dave-the-programmed-paladin)

Built with **Generative Artificial Intelligence** using **Meta's llama3.1 70b Large Language Model**. This project accomplishes these steps:

1. Start a story with an initial story chunk (some paragraphs).
2. Continue writing the next story chunk using the previous story chunk as context.
3. Write the stories to this README.md file with dated entries.
4. Automate the git commands to commit and push to this repository.
5. Cronjob the script to run 24x a day

### Features I found cool when building

#### Groq API

**Using [Groq](https://groq.com/) for LLM's is intuitive and easy.** the syntax and responses received from the model are easily understood and can allow for great debugging. Groq was also chosen over [OpenAI's GPT models](https://openai.com/api/) because Groq is **free** and has **fast-inference's** meaning the story generation is extremely fast.

The fact this model is free (hopefully for a long time) allows for the great learning and exploration of using LLM's to make projects like this that **experiment with how models behave when in a continuous conversation and creating content akin to a writing style and theme.**

As Groq introduces newer models, perhaps the story may become more fluid over time.

#### Algorithms

I had to really design and think about how the story generation will be organized so that the LLM can parse the recent stories. I knew i needed to separate eah story so i separated them by the markdown line `---\n`

In my learning i optimized retrieving the latest story. This was done by sending a pointer to the end of file and use a reading window (buffer) that will expand its memory only when the story separator is not within the window. Once found, the most recent story chunk is retrieved and cleaned to hold the story text to give the LLM context for the next story.

#### Python Packaging

I learned how to properly use `__init__.py` and create sub-packages within the project such as `utils`, `tools`, and `update`

#### Automated git commits and push to GitHub

One very interesting feature i learned is that i can use system calls to send git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push origin master`. This proved useful to keep updating the repository as the script runs without human input (apart form setting up SSH keys for secure connections)

The other feature is that cronjobs on Linux are very useful to run the script as a background process, simply requiring a workstation to be online. This can be done by editing the cronjob file with the following command:

```bash
crontab -e
```

**Note:** the cronjobs need to be in the following format (with script running every day at time 16:00)

```bash
00 16 * * * cd /path/to/repository ; source path/to/venv/bin/activate ; path/to/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/repository/main.py
```

This cronjob essentially runs the command to cd to the repository, spin up the python virtual environment, then use that virtual environments python version to execute the main script.

## Now enough of the technical stuff... Lets see how Dave is doing

## The Story of Dave the Programmed Paladin

**Date Written:** 2024-11-26 19:54:19

The sun was setting over the rolling hills of the countryside, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling wagon train. Dave, a young and ambitious paladin, sat perched on the edge of a wooden wagon, his eyes fixed on the horizon as the wheels creaked and groaned beneath him. He wore a suit of battered leather armor and carried a sturdy warhammer across his knees, his hands drumming a rhythmic beat on the handle as he bounced along the rough terrain.

To his left sat Elara, a young half-elf with a mischievous glint in her eye, her hair tied back in a loose braid and her fingers deftly weaving a wooden flute from a length of tender ash. She played a lively tune, the notes skipping and dancing like a leaf on a breeze as the wagon bounced along. To Dave's right sat Old Tom, a grizzled veteran of countless battles, his face etched with scars and his eyes squinting into the sunlight as he sharpened a worn blade with a whetstone.

"Bluestone's just ahead, lads and lasses," Old Tom declared, his voice like worn leather, "and I reckon we'll be lucky to make it in one piece. Roads ain't what they used to be, and I've heard tell of bandits and orcs on the prowl." Elara's flute playing faltered for a moment, her eyes darting nervously towards the paladin, before she shifted back into her lively tune. Dave, meanwhile, simply smiled and nodded, his hand resting on the pommel of his warhammer.

The wagon train crested a small hill, and as they descended into the valley below, the town of Bluestone came into view. Nestled in the heart of a deep valley, surrounded by towering mountains that seemed to lean in on it, the town was a patchwork of brightly colored buildings and chaotic streets. Smoke curled up from the town's many chimneys, mingling with the sweet scent of baking bread and the stench of butchered meat.

As the wagon train approached the town's main gate, a pair of sturdy guards eyed the travelers warily, their hands resting on the hafts of their spears. One of the guards, a burly man with a thick beard and a scar above his eyebrow, hopped down from the gatehouse and strode towards the wagon. "Halt, travelers! Who are you, and what business do you have in Bluestone?" he boomed, eyeing Dave's warhammer and Elara's flute with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

Old Tom stood up, his eyes squinting as he stretched his back, and bowed low to the guard. "Ah, good fellow, we're just a group of humble travelers seeking to earn a buck in your fair town. This young fellow here's a paladin, from the monastery in the north – he's here to take on some local quests, and perhaps bring a bit of justice to the area." The guard's eyes flickered to Dave, his expression softening ever so slightly as he took in the paladin's chiseled features and gleaming armor. "Ah, well, in that case, you're welcome in Bluestone. Just be careful, travelers – there's been rumors of strange happenings out in the valley. Tools gone missing, strange noises at night, and that kind of thing. Can't quite put our finger on it, but we've had to increase the night watch just in case."

As the guard finished speaking, Elara's flute playing grew softer, her eyes darting up at Dave with a curious glint. "Sounds like there's a bit of work to be done, then," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the rattling wagon. Dave smiled, a fierce light igniting in his eyes as he nodded in agreement. The gods, it seemed, were already guiding his path – and the adventure was only just beginning.
