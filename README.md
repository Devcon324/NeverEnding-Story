# The-NeverEnding-Story

## Background Information, How It's Made

### What is this?

We follow Dave, our Programmed Paladin on his adventure!

This is an self-continuing story that is updated 3x a day on GitHub.

Built with Generative Artificial Intelligence using Meta's llama3 70b Large Language Model. This project accomplishes these steps:

1. Start a story with an initial story chunk (some paragraphs)
2. Use the previous story chunk as context to write the next story chunk
3. Write the stories to this README.md file with dated entries
4. automate the git commands to commit and push to this repository
5. cronjob the script to run 3x a day at 00:00, 08:00, and 16:00

### Features I found cool when building

#### using groq API

Using Groq for LLM's is intuitive and easy. the syntax and responses received from the model are easily understood and can allow for great debugging.

The fact this model is free (hopefully for a long time) allows for the great learning and exploration of using LLM's to make projects like this that explore how mnodels behave when in a continuous conversation.

## The Story of Dave the Programmed Paladin

The sun was setting over the rolling hills of Faerûn as a worn wagon rattled along the dusty road. Inside, a mix of tired peasants huddled together, their faces etched with the weariness of travel. Amidst them sat Dave, a young paladin with a sense of restlessness that seemed to grow by the day. Clad in simple, unadorned armor, his blond hair tied back in a ponytail, he gazed out at the horizon, his eyes fixed on the faint outline of the StarMountains in the distance. His fellow travelers, all folk who had never ventured far from their humble beginnings, watched him with curiosity and suspicion. This was, after all, a paladin leaving the safety of a monastery to traverse the unpredictable roads of Faerûn.

"Where are ye headed, lad?" asked a gruff old fellow to Dave's left. His name was Grimbold Ironfist, a sturdy blacksmith from a small village to the north. Grimbold had lost an arm in battle and sported a gleaming mechanical replacement that creaked as he shifted on the wooden bench.

"I'm headed to Bluestone," Dave replied, his voice firm but laced with a hint of trepidation. "I've heard the town is seeking brave adventurers to... aid in the protection of its citizens."

A hooded figure near the back of the wagon leaned forward, eyes glinting with curiosity. "Protection from what, exactly?" she asked, her voice husky and mysterious.

Dave's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his sword, an unadorned steel blade he had been given by the monks at the monastery. "I've heard rumors of strange happenings in the nearby forests – whispers of goblins and wild beasts. Bluestone needs someone to investigate."

The peasants exchanged uneasy glances, no doubt thinking about the perils that lay ahead. As for Dave, he felt a thrill of excitement course through his veins, the prospect of adventure igniting a fire within him.

"You're either brave or crazy," Grimbold chuckled, eyeing Dave's unwavering determination. "I reckon it's a bit of both."

The wagon rumbled onward, the travelers subsiding into silence as night began to fall. The stars twinkled above, casting a magical glow over the landscape, as the passengers drifted off to sleep, their dreams filled with the promise of the unknown adventures that lay ahead.

As the night deepened, the air grew cooler, filled with the scent of damp earth and the distant calls of nocturnal creatures. The wagon continued to rattle along the road, the rhythmic thud of its wooden wheels on the dusty terrain lulling the travelers into fitful slumber. Dave, however, remained wide awake, his eyes fixed on the starry expanse above, the beam of a pale moonlight casting an ethereal glow across the rolling hills.

As the hours crept by, a silence fell over the wagon, broken only by the occasional snore or creak of the wheels. The hooded figure near the back of the wagon, her face hidden behind a veil of shadows, seemed to be watching Dave with an intensity that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Her eyes gleamed like two sapphires in the moonlight, an air of mystery surrounding her that was both captivating and unnerving.

Just as the night seemed to be at its darkest, the wagon listed to one side, its wheels grating on a patch of rough terrain. The peasants stirred, their sleep-addled eyes blinking in confusion as the wagon creaked and groaned, threatening to topple over. Grimbold Ironfist coughed loudly, his mechanical arm creaking in protest as he jerked upright.

"What in the seven heavens?" he exclaimed, rubbing his bleary eyes.

Dave leapt to his feet, his hand instinctively going to the hilt of his sword. "We seem to have encountered a spot of rough ground," he said, peering out into the darkness.

As the wagon corrected its balance and continued to rumble forward, the driver – a stubby-nosed man named Jepson – grunted a hasty apology over his shoulder. "Sorry about the jolt, friends," he said, his breath misting in the cool air. "Just a bit of rough road ahead."

As the wagon trundled on, its passengers slowly settled back into their slumber. The hooded figure remained awake, her eyes fixed intently on Dave as the wagon rattled into the darkness. Her features seemed to shift in the flickering moonlight, taking on a subtle yet unsettling aspect that made Dave feel like a mouse beneath the gaze of a hawk.

As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, the wagon rounded a bend in the road, revealing a silhouette etched against the rising sun: the sleepy village of Ashfall, its wooden rooftops and thatched haystacks stark against the growing light. The air was heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, a hearty scent that stirred the travelers from their slumber.

"Well, we're making good time," Grimbold said with a grin, rubbing his one arm over his chest. "Bluestone won't be far now."

As the villagers began to stir, the wagon drew closer to the heart of Ashfall. Dave spotted figures gathered near the village gate, their eyes watching the wagon's approach. Something in their demeanor seemed wary, even hostile, an air of unease that clung to the village like a shroud.

"Welcome to Ashfall, traveler," one of them growled, stepping forward with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. "But don't be thinkin' of stayin' too long. We've got trouble brewin' in these parts."

The villager's words hung in the air, casting a somber mood over the group as they disembarked from the wagon. The sun continued to rise, casting a warm glow over the village, but the atmosphere remained chilly. The peasants on the wagon eyed the villager warily, exchanging nervous glances as they gathered their belongings. Jepson, the wagon driver, merely shrugged and hopped off the wagon, stretching his short legs as he surveyed the village.

Dave's gaze lingered on the villager, a man with a weathered face and a thick beard that seemed to hold a lifetime of secrets. The villager's eyes darted towards the hooded figure, who had stepped off the wagon with an air of quiet confidence. For a moment, the two locked gazes, their faces expressionless. Dave sensed a spark of tension between them, an unspoken connection that spoke of shared knowledge and hidden meanings.

The villager turned back to the wagon driver, his voice brusque. "You're the supply wagon from Harvesthale, ain't ya?" He nodded at the stack of goods lashed to the wagon's bed.

Jepson nodded in affirmation. "Aye, that's right. Bringing in goods for the villagers here."

The villager's expression grew more serious, his brow furrowing in concern. "Well, we'll be glad of the supplies, but like I said, we've got... issues here. Bandits been raiding nearby farms, and our folk are spooked." He eyed the hooded figure warily, his voice dropping to a whisper. "And there's other rumors. Things that the wind carries, of troubles deeper than thieves and rascals."

Grimbold snorted, rubbing his mechanical arm over his chest. "Sounds like any village out in the Boar Downs, eh?" His chuckle was awkward, tinged with a touch of unease. The hooded figure merely listened, her eyes narrowing as she absorbed the villager's words.

A figure emerged from the heart of the village, her face marked by creases of worry and exhaustion. "Elleren," the villager called out to her, as she approached the wagon. She drew up beside the villager, eyeing the wagon and its occupants with a wary intensity.

"I'm Cador," the villager said, pointing to himself. "This is Elleren, the village elder. She's the one you'll want to talk to, if you're looking to do business or rest for a spell." He nodded towards the figure beside him, her silver hair twisted into neat braids that hung down her back like tangles of vines.

Elleren's gaze swept over the wagon's occupants, her eyes lingering on Dave with a concerned expression. She hesitated, then spoke in a voice marked by its deep conviction. "Ah, travelers. I see you've arrived in Ashfall. We've been expecting... well, perhaps not exactly you, but visitors." Her eyes seemed to hold secrets and curiosity in equal measure.

"We've got news of troubles brewing in the hills," Grimbold chimed in, recalling a mixture of excitement and trepidation in his voice. "Dark forces stirring in the lands to the north."

Elleren nodded solemnly, her eyes betraying the depth of the fear that hung in the air. "Yes. We've heard the stories too. These lands, here in Ashfall, know plenty about fear. We've felt the change in the air, long before it spread throughout the lands."
